# Summary

* Tokr creates decentralized private equity and debt markets for financing real-world assets.&#x20;
* The Tokr protocol certifies that rNFTs represent real property ownership and verifies the collateral value of rNFTs.&#x20;
* Stakeholders can trust that recording the transfer of rNFT ownership on-chain results in the transfer of real property ownership off-chain.&#x20;
* Buyers and sellers can instantly exchange real property ownership without costly intermediaries such as brokers and agents.&#x20;
* Users can supply tokens such as USDC to earn interest on-chain with real property as collateral off-chain, without traditional intermediaries such as banks, brokers, or fund managers.&#x20;
* Users can instantly borrow USDC by supplying real property (off-chain) as collateral, represented digitally as rNFTs (on-chain), without onerous underwriting processes required by traditional intermediaries such as banks, brokers, or fund managers.
