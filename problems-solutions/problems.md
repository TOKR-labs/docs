# Problems

List of problems that need solving

### Narrowly Scoped

1. Can we store files in a realms proposal?
   1. If not:
      1. How can we store these docs on chain in a secure manner?
2. How to filter non-TOKR created DAOS on our page?
   1. Can a tag be added on creation of the DAO used in subsequent filters?
3. How can we get price on the NFT/fractional shares?
4. What exact docs do we need for TOKR to verify ownership?
   1. EIN
   2. Articles of Org
   3. Title
   4. etc?
5. Who should have authority (tokr dao vs peer dao):
   1. update\_authority
   2. master vs print

### Broadly Scoped

1. What is the maximum utility an NFT (or fractional shares of the NFT)could provide, that could be built by march 17th?
   1. Leverage full NFT?
   2. Leverage fractional shares?
2. How can we facilitate transfer of the NFT on sale of the asset?
3. How to get equity distribution from a previous raise to the dao members? EX a DAO that already has an asset now wishes to have TOKR DAO mint an NFT and fractionalize it. If we don't know how much each member contributed to the treasury, how could we facilitate this?
